            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="card">
                McMaster Chess Club aims to create a friendly space for players of all
                skill levels to explore their interests in chess. Don't be shy - most
                players are beginners and intermediates at the club. Everyone is welcome
                to come to club meetings to play games, talk, meet new people and more.
                There is no registration fee to join. While most meetings don't
                have a rigid format, we run prize tournaments every so often. Events
                include: chess boxing, blitz, team battles against other universities,
                arenas, co-hosted events with other clubs and more.
                <br><br>
                As of the Winter 2023 semester, our general meetings are hosted each Wednesday
                from 6:00 to 8:00 in the main Club space (MUSC room 215).
                <br><br>
                The biggest competition is when we participate in the Canadian University
                Chess Championships (CUCC) every year. CUCC is five rounds and sees
                universities across Canada compete. Our best results are tying for 4th
                in the championships section and winning the reserves (u-1800 section) in
                2017 and 2020. We hold chess team qualifier tournaments in the first
                semester, and CUCC takes place in January or February. We typically send
                1-2 teams (4 players each) to the tournament. In 2023, we sent 3 teams of
                4 players each.
