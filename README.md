# McMaster Chess Club Website

A website that I built so that people can learn more about the McMaster Chess Club.

## I learned how to:

* Incorporate basic Bootstrap, for elements including:
    * Collapsible navbar
    * Sticky footer
    * Photos carousel 
* Use media queries to make the website mobile-friendly
* Add a background image and keep it centered when the window is resized
* Include a chess puzzle 
* Have link open in new tab
